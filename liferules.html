<h2>Guidelines For Life:</h2>
<p>1. Season your behaviour with class.<br>
2. Listen more than you talk.  Know more about your audience than they know about you.<br>
3. Keep some cards under the table at all times.<br>
4. Consider that you are worth being heard.<br>
5. Time and energy are in scarcity.  Spend them on people or projects with intention.<br>
6. You cannot avoid becoming unreasonable.  Recognize irrationality.  Always behave with class.<br>
7. What you've done is an indicator and not a definition of who you are.<br>
8. Cherish complements internally.  Consider critisisms.<br>
